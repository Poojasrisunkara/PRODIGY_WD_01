## Responsive Landing Page

This project is a part of the internship at Prodigy Info Tech. The goal of this project is to create a responsive and interactive landing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The landing page consists of three CSS files for styling - `lp.css`, `lp1.css`, and `lp2.css`, and a JavaScript file `lp.js` for interactivity.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the landing page.
- `lp.css`: CSS file containing the base styles for the landing page.
- `lp1.css` and `lp2.css`: Additional CSS files for styling variations.
- `lp.js`: JavaScript file for adding interactivity to the landing page.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The landing page is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Interactive Elements**: JavaScript is used to add interactive elements such as animations, sliders, or form validations to enhance user engagement.
- **Modular CSS**: Styles are divided into multiple CSS files (`lp.css`, `lp1.css`, `lp2.css`) for better organization and maintainability.

## Responsive Landing Page

This project is a part of the internship at Prodigy Info Tech. The goal of this project is to create a responsive and interactive landing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The landing page consists of three CSS files for styling - `lp.css`, `lp1.css`, and `lp2.css`, and a JavaScript file `lp.js` for interactivity.
